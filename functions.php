 * "Funny, 'cause I look around at this world you're so eager to be a part of and all I see is six billion
 * lunatics looking for the fastest ride out. Who's not crazy? Look around, everyone's drinking, smoking,
 * shooting up, shooting each other, or just plain screwing their brains out 'cause they don't want 'em anymore.
 * I'm crazy? Honey, I'm the original one-eyed chicklet in the kingdom of the blind, 'cause at least I admit the
 * world makes me nuts. Name one person who can take it here. That's all I'm asking. Name one."
